# substreams-websocket — agent guide

This is a Substreams-to-WebSocket fan-out server. It runs one or more `db_out`-style Substreams packages and broadcasts decoded `sf.substreams.sink.database.v1.DatabaseChanges` block payloads as JSON over WebSocket.

If you're an AI agent or programmatic client, this page tells you everything you need to know to connect and consume the stream. Source: <https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-websocket>.

## Server URL conventions

Stream selectors are `<network>@<table>` (Binance market-streams style). `*` is a wildcard on either side. `<network>` is a chain identifier (e.g. `solana-mainnet`, `ethereum-mainnet`). `<table>` is the DatabaseChanges table emitted by the spkg's `db_out` module (e.g. `swaps`, `transfers`, `spl_transfers`).

The `<network>` side also accepts a comma-separated list to subscribe to the same table across multiple chains in one selector: `<n1>,<n2>,...@<table>` (e.g. `solana-mainnet,ethereum-mainnet@swaps`). The server expands it into one entry per network — `LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS` echoes the expanded form. Mixing `*` with named networks (`*,solana-mainnet@swaps`) is rejected; use a bare `*` instead. Comma on the `<table>` side is not supported.

Two URL modes:

| URL | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| `/ws/<a>` | Single channel — raw JSON payload per block. |
| `/ws/<a>/<b>/...` | Multiple channels — every payload wrapped as `{"stream":"<network>@<table>","data":<raw>}`. |
| `/stream?streams=<a>/<b>/...` | Combined query mode — always wraps. |

Bare `/ws` (no streams) returns HTTP 400. Use `/ws/*@*` to subscribe to everything explicitly.

Examples:

```
wss://<host>/ws/solana-mainnet@swaps
wss://<host>/ws/solana-mainnet@swaps/ethereum-mainnet@transfers
wss://<host>/ws/*@swaps
wss://<host>/ws/solana-mainnet,ethereum-mainnet@swaps
wss://<host>/stream?streams=*@*
```

## Welcome message

On connect, the server sends a single `session` message describing every configured stream and the connection's parsed subscriptions.

```json
{
  "type": "session",
  "status": "connected",
  "client_id": 1,
  "streams": [
    {
      "network": "solana-mainnet",
      "module": "db_out",
      "manifest": "https://.../svm-dex-v0.5.1.spkg",
      "module_hash": "bd388f2e39f5dcc237cfbdb8d6c96d9e5678c797",
      "package_name": "svm_dex",
      "package_version": "v0.5.1",
      "tables": ["swaps"]
    }
  ],
  "subscriptions": ["solana-mainnet@swaps"],
  "wrap_envelope": false
}
```

- `streams` lists every Substreams source the server reads. Each entry is identified by `(network, package_name, package_version, module_hash)` — there is no operator-defined name. The optional `tables` array advertises which DatabaseChanges tables that spkg emits, so clients can build a discovery UI without waiting for blocks. When present it is also the complete allowlist of broadcast tables — the server drops rows for any table not listed, so a `network@table` outside this set will never deliver. When absent, every table the spkg emits is broadcast.
- `subscriptions` is what this connection will actually receive (filtered set). Selectors are `<network>@<table>` where `<table>` is a DatabaseChanges table emitted by the spkg's `db_out`.
- `wrap_envelope` tells you whether subsequent payloads are wrapped in `{"stream","data"}` or sent raw.

## Block payload shape

One message per `(network, table)` group per block. A spkg that emits both `swaps` and `transfers` produces **two** per-table broadcasts per block.

```json
{
  "network": "solana-mainnet",
  "table": "swaps",
  "block_num": 350000000,
  "block_hash": "Gsk6...",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-13 17:00:00",
  "module_hash": "bd388f2e...",
  "events": [
    {
      "input_amount": "1287000000",
      "input_mint": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
      "output_amount": "6848381008732",
      "output_mint": "13muFY...",
      "protocol": "raydium_cpmm",
      "user": "F2MUE..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Field reference:

- `network` + `table` — together identify the subscription channel.
- `block_num`, `block_hash`, `timestamp` — block-level metadata. Timestamps are UTC `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
- `module_hash` — canonical 40-hex SHA-1 of the Substreams output module. Use it to detect spkg upgrades.
- `events` — array of rows for this table only, in source order. The per-event `@table` prefix is dropped since the parent payload already names the table.
- All values inside `events[*]` are strings on the wire (per DatabaseChanges proto). Numeric types are stringified; the agent must parse.
- The keys `block_num`, `block_hash`, `timestamp`, `minute` are stripped from each event because they duplicate top-level meta.
- Upstream `ordinal`, `operation`, `pk`/`composite_pk`, `update_op` are dropped — never surfaced.
- ClickHouse-backfill provenance columns are dropped on the wire: EVM `tx_index`, `tx_nonce`, `tx_gas_price`, `tx_gas_limit`, `tx_gas_used`, `tx_value`, `log_index`, `log_block_index`, `log_topics`, `log_data`, all `call_*` (caller/index/begin_ordinal/end_ordinal/address/value/gas_consumed/gas_limit/depth/parent_index/type); SVM `compute_units_consumed`, `stack_height`, and the SVM transaction `fee` (the latter only when the row also carries `compute_units_consumed`, so EVM `swap_fee.fee` survives). Kept: `tx_hash`, `tx_from`, `tx_to`, `log_ordinal`, `log_address`, `signature`, `fee_payer`, `program_id`.
- Any field whose key ends in `_raw` is treated as a comma-joined list: the value is split on `,` and re-emitted as a JSON array under the suffix-stripped key (e.g. `signers_raw: "a,b,c"` becomes `signers: ["a","b","c"]`). Empty strings become empty arrays.

When `wrap_envelope` is `true`, the same object is delivered nested under `data`:

```json
{ "stream": "solana-mainnet@swaps", "data": { /* the above */ } }
```

## Stream lifecycle messages

Same connection, separate envelope identified by `"type": "stream"`. Lifecycle messages are **scoped to the network you subscribed to**: a client only receives `started`/`completed`/`error`/`decode_error`/`fatal`/`undo` frames for networks its selectors cover (a `*@…` wildcard on the network side matches every network). They carry spkg provenance (`package_name`, `package_version`, `module_hash`) so clients can still route per-package on their own. The `dropped` frame is connection-wide and always delivered (see below).

```
{ "type": "stream", "status": "started",      "network": "...", "package_name": "...", "package_version": "...", "module_hash": "..." }
{ "type": "stream", "status": "completed",    ... }
{ "type": "stream", "status": "error",        ..., "message": "..." }
{ "type": "stream", "status": "decode_error", ..., "message": "..." }
{ "type": "stream", "status": "fatal",        ..., "message": "..." }
{ "type": "stream", "status": "undo",         ..., "last_valid_block": 350000000 }
{ "type": "stream", "status": "dropped",   "count": 42, "last_block": 350000000, "last_timestamp": 1715619300, "reason": "client buffer overflow; frames were dropped" }
```

`undo` fires on chain reorganizations. Roll back any state materialized past `last_valid_block`.

`dropped` fires when your connection was too slow: the server's bounded per-client buffer overflowed and `count` frames were dropped on the floor. It is sent **once, on the first frame that gets through after the gap** — `last_block` and `last_timestamp` (Unix epoch seconds) mark where delivery resumed, so the hole sits between the last block you processed and that point. `count` is connection-wide (the outbound buffer is shared across all your subscribed channels, so a drop can't be pinned to one `network@table`). Reconcile the gap from another source — this feed is live-only, so backfill the hole with Substreams (resume from `last_block` / `last_timestamp`) — instead of shipping incomplete data downstream. If you never want to be dropped, drain your socket faster or run a server-to-server consumer with `SLOW_CLIENT_DROP_LIMIT=0`. In wrap-envelope (combined-stream) mode the frame arrives as `{"stream":"<network>@__dropped__","data":{...}}`.

## Live SUBSCRIBE / UNSUBSCRIBE / LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS

After connect, send JSON text frames to mutate the subscription set. Each command is a single object; the server replies with one object.

### Request envelope

```json
{ "method": "<METHOD>", "params": [<string>, ...], "id": <any json> }
```

- `method` — `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`, or `LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS`. Case-sensitive.
- `params` — array of `network@stream` selectors. Required for `SUBSCRIBE`/`UNSUBSCRIBE`. Ignored for `LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS`.
- `id` — echoed on the reply. Use a number to correlate.

### Reply envelope

```json
{ "result": null | [<string>, ...], "id": <echoed> }
{ "error":  "<message>",            "id": <echoed-or-null> }
```

Invalid commands do **not** close the connection.

### Examples

```json
{ "method": "SUBSCRIBE",         "params": ["solana-mainnet@swaps"], "id": 1 }
// -> { "result": null, "id": 1 }

{ "method": "UNSUBSCRIBE",       "params": ["solana-mainnet@swaps"], "id": 2 }
// -> { "result": null, "id": 2 }

{ "method": "LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS", "id": 3 }
// -> { "result": ["solana-mainnet@swaps"], "id": 3 }
```

### Rules

- `SUBSCRIBE` is idempotent. Re-subscribing is a no-op.
- `UNSUBSCRIBE` silently ignores unknown selectors. To remove a wildcard, pass the exact wildcard form.
- `wrap_envelope` is fixed at upgrade time. To change envelope mode, reconnect.
- `SUBSCRIBE` does not push a snapshot. Only future blocks are delivered.

## Event filters

Reduce bandwidth by asking the server to drop non-matching events before delivery. The filter is an **SQE expression string** (StreamingFast Substreams Query Expression — the same language as Firehose `substreams run -t`). Pass `?filter=<url-encoded-expr>` (alias `?sqe=`) on the WebSocket upgrade, or use the live `SET_FILTER` / `CLEAR_FILTER` / `LIST_FILTERS` commands. A filter is scoped to a `network@stream` selector and applies to every block whose `(network, table)` that selector matches — including wildcard selectors (`*@*`, `<network>@*`, `*@<table>`). When several stored filters match the same outgoing event, **all** of them must pass.

### Expression syntax

```
maker:0xW                          field equals value (exact, case-sensitive)
maker:0xW || taker:0xW             OR — wallet as maker OR taker
protocol:clob && maker:0xW         AND (whitespace also means AND: `protocol:clob maker:0xW`)
(maker:0xW || taker:0xW) && !amm:0xdead   grouping + negation
0xWALLET                           bare term: matches when ANY column equals 0xWALLET
"two words"  or  label:'a b'       quote values containing spaces or ( ) | & ' "
```

- `field:value` — exact, **case-sensitive** string equality on that event column (match the on-wire casing; EVM addresses are lowercased on the wire). An event missing `field` is a miss.
- bare `value` (no `field:`) — matches when **any** string column of the event equals it. Great for "this wallet in any role": `0xW1 || 0xW2`.
- operators: `||` (or), `&&` or whitespace (and), `!` (not), `( )` (grouping). `&&` binds tighter than `||`.
- only `events[*]` columns are filtered; top-level `block_num` / `network` / `module_hash` are not.

```
ws://host/ws/polymarket@ctfexchange_order_filled?filter=maker%3A0xW%20%7C%7C%20taker%3A0xW
```

```json
{ "method": "SET_FILTER",
  "params": ["polymarket@ctfexchange_order_filled", "tx_from:0xW || maker:0xW || taker:0xW"],
  "id": 1 }
// -> { "result": null, "id": 1 }   on accept
// -> { "error":  "...", "id": 1 }   on reject (previous filter left unchanged)
```

`SET_FILTER` **replaces** the filter for that selector — it does not accumulate, so two `SET_FILTER` for the same selector keep only the last (combine with `||` in one expression instead). `CLEAR_FILTER` removes it. `LIST_FILTERS` returns the active selector→expression map; an empty `{}` means **no filter is active** — use it to confirm one took effect.

Each client receives a block carrying **only its matching events** — non-matching events are dropped from that client's copy before it's sent (so filtered streams aren't bloated with rows you didn't ask for), and if no event in a block matches, the block isn't sent to that client at all.

Limits are server-configured: `SUBSTREAMS_WEBSOCKET_MAX_FILTER_VALUES` (default 256) caps the **total number of terms** in the expression, and `SUBSTREAMS_WEBSOCKET_MAX_FILTER_FIELDS` (default 16) caps distinct field names. A payload over a cap, with a parse error, or that isn't a string returns an `error` reply (e.g. `filter exceeds max terms (total across the expression): 300 > 256`) and **leaves the previous filter unchanged**; the socket stays open. Always read the `SET_FILTER` reply — a silently-ignored `error` looks exactly like "the filter did nothing" (you keep receiving the full stream).

## Reconnects (live-only feed)

This WebSocket is a **live-only** convenience feed: it delivers blocks as they arrive and does not buffer history for replay. On reconnect you simply resume the live stream — there is no server-side catch-up.

The query parameters `?from_timestamp=` and `?from_block=` are **not supported**. Passing either returns **HTTP 400 at the WebSocket upgrade**: the feed is live-only, so use **Substreams** to backfill by block or timestamp. Substreams natively resumes from any block, cursor, or timestamp and is the correct tool for historical replay.

Cursor handling stays internal to the server: on restart each stream resumes from its persisted cursor so the live feed continues without operator action. That cursor is not exposed to clients and is unrelated to client reconnects.

## Heartbeats

The server sends WebSocket ping frames every `SUBSTREAMS_WEBSOCKET_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS` (default 180s). Standard WebSocket clients pong automatically. The server closes connections that don't pong within `SUBSTREAMS_WEBSOCKET_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 600s).

## Discovery endpoints

Before opening a WebSocket, you can probe the server over plain HTTP:

- `GET /healthz` — `200 ok` if the server is live, `503` if it is draining.
- `GET /streams` — JSON listing of every configured `(network, package_name, package_version, module_hash, tables)`. Use this to confirm your target `network@table` exists before you connect.
- `GET /openapi` (also `/openapi.json`) — OpenAPI 3.1 document describing every HTTP GET route. Paths reflect the runtime config.
- `GET /` — interactive browser client (Scalar-style reference + try-it panel).

Or just connect to `wss://<host>/ws/*@*` and read the `session` message — it advertises every available stream and its tables.

## Client-side troubleshooting

- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'websockets'` — install the Python `websockets` package (add to `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
- `TypeError: ... unexpected keyword argument ...` on connect — your WebSocket library renamed a kwarg between versions (e.g. `extra_headers` vs `additional_headers` in Python `websockets`). Match the kwarg to the installed version.
- Silent disconnects or close code `1009` (`message too big`) on busy chains (Solana especially) — raise your client's max frame/message size to at least `32 MiB` (Python: `max_size=32 * 1024 * 1024`).
- Socket opens but no payloads — re-check your selector (`<network>@<table>`), confirm the table exists in `/streams` or `session.streams[].tables`.
- Stream lifecycle frames with `"status":"error"` or `"status":"fatal"` carry upstream errors — surface `message` to the user and reconnect to resume the live stream.

## Common agent recipes

### "Tail every event from a single stream"

```
wss://<host>/ws/solana-mainnet@swaps
```

Payloads come raw, no envelope. Parse top-level fields directly.

### "Tail two streams and demultiplex"

```
wss://<host>/ws/solana-mainnet@swaps/solana-mainnet@transfers
```

Each frame is `{"stream":"<id>","data":...}`. Switch on `stream` to dispatch.

### "Tail every swaps stream across chains"

```
wss://<host>/ws/*@swaps
```

### "Connect, then narrow"

```
1. Connect to wss://<host>/ws/*@*
2. Receive welcome → inspect `streams[]` to see what's available
3. Send LIST_SUBSCRIPTIONS to confirm current set
4. Send UNSUBSCRIBE / SUBSCRIBE to narrow
```

### "Detect spkg upgrades"

Compare each broadcast's `module_hash` with the one you saw in the welcome message. If they differ, the operator deployed a new spkg — schema may have changed.

## What this server does NOT do

- **No replay / no historical backfill.** The feed is live-only — there is no on-disk replay log and `?from_timestamp=` / `?from_block=` are rejected at upgrade (HTTP 400). For any history, use Substreams directly with the desired `start_block` (or cursor/timestamp); Substreams does per-block/timestamp replay far better than a fan-out feed could.
- **No payload transformation.** Field values are pass-through strings from the source DatabaseChanges. Numeric parsing, decimal handling, base58 / hex encoding are the consumer's responsibility.
- **No persistence of historical messages.** Once a block is broadcast, it's gone unless a connected subscriber received it.

## When to use this server

Good fit:
- Real-time consumption of Substreams `DatabaseChanges` over WebSocket
- Fan-out to many subscribers from a single Substreams reader
- Cross-chain consumption from a unified URL pattern

Bad fit:
- Historical backfill (use Substreams gRPC directly with a `start_block`)
- Snapshotting / point-in-time queries (use a SQL sink instead)
- Anything other than `sf.substreams.sink.database.v1.DatabaseChanges` outputs
